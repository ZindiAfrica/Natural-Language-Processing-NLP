# Competition Summary

## Description

In a country such as Senegal, where about 50% of the population is illiterate, technologies and applications that are designed to be used by people who can read are not as effective as they could be.

The challenge focused on a public transport use case for two reasons.

First, many users of public transport can’t read or speak French, so they can’t interact with existing apps that help passengers to find a bus for a given destination. 

And second, there is already an existing app in Senegal, WeeGo, which helps passengers to get transport information.

The objective of this competition is to build an ASR model that will help illiterate people use existing apps to find which bus they can take to reach their destination, without having to know how to read or write.



## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).



## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

There were 6683 audio files in the train set and 1590 in the test set.

The use of any metadata associated with the audio files was not allowed.

Pretrained models were permitted as long as they are openly available to everyone.



## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.



## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)



## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.



## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Word Error Rate Metric.



## Prizes

1st Place: $1 000 USD

2nd Place: $600 USD

3rd Place: $400 USD



## Benefits

The solutions will help illiterate people to interact with apps with just their voice, in a language they can already speak.
