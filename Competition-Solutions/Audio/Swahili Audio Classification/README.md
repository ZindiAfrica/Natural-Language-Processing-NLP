# Competition Summary

## Description

Indigenous African languages are increasingly making their way into modern apps and technology services, across a wide range of sectors including health, media, financial services etc. With more than 100 million speakers across East and Southern Africa, Swahili is a key target language for digitisation. This dataset was collected by Zindi in 2021 as a curated dataset for introduction to automatic speech recognition (ASR) - a competitive ASR model for Swahili would enable many innovative solutions and new technologies that would help East Africa develop.

The objective of this challenge is to create an automatic speech recognition solution to classify simple Swahilie audio into text. This solution can be used by telecommunication companies for voice or text prompts, or to help in translation, public health or emergency services.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

The data consists of mp3 files with unique IDs as file names.

The training data consists of 1857 audio files, recorded by hundreds of contributors and shared through xeno-canto. 

The competition focus on 40 birds whose calls are frequently heard in Southern Africa.

We are grateful to the many citizen scientists and researchers who shared the recordings which made this competition possible.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Log Loss.
