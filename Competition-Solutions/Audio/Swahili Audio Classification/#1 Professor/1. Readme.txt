Hi Guys, thanks for such a wonderful weekend Hack. Please find attached my basic solution for your Perusal.

The notebooks run on Google Colab platform - I'm using the colab pro version
The notebooks itself can be run in any order except the final ensemble notebook. The notebooks to run include:

1. One_0.022
2. two_0.044
3. three_0.022
4. four_hug_me
5. five_Hug me 20 Times
5. six_Hug me 20 Times

After running all these notebooks, you can ensemble the output using the Final Ensemble notebook.

Thanks once again!
