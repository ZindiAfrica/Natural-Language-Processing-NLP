# Competition Summary

## Description

Southern Africa is home to around 960 bird species, some of which are found nowhere else on the globe.

Unfortunately, some species are under threat due to habitat loss, climate change or disease.

It is important to monitor the health of bird populations across the region, both for the conservation of the birds themselves and as a key indicator of overall ecosystem health.

The objective of this competition is to create a model capable of identifying birds by their calls.



## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

The data consists of mp3 files with unique IDs as file names.

The training data consists of 1857 audio files, recorded by hundreds of contributors and shared through xeno-canto. 

The competition focus on 40 birds whose calls are frequently heard in Southern Africa.

We are grateful to the many citizen scientists and researchers who shared the recordings which made this competition possible.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge was Log Loss.


## Prizes

The top 10 submissions earned up to 2000 Zindi Points.

## Benefits

The solutions could enable automatic identification of birds based on audio collected by remote microphones, drastically reducing the human input required for population monitoring.
