ello,

I enjoyed participating in this competition and was surprised that I obtained the result that I did. I have never placed and had to submit code before.

I am including the ZIP of my files from github (https://github.com/btk1/Zindi-Fowl-Escapades) which I used for the winning solution. I am not including the original MP3 files or the PNG output from the starter notebook (no modification of parameters). If I need to do that, please let me know and I will. But I will have to send the files via WeTransfer or something like that.

I hope that this is what you need, but please let me know if not.

Thank you so much for organizing such interesting competitions that will hopefully be of use to the data science community in Africa and around the world.

Kind regards,
William Miller
