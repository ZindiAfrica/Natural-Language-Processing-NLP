# Competition Summary

## Description

In Uganda, radio programs are a critical mode for sharing information and reaching out to rural communities.

Farmers throughout Uganda, and across Africa, rely on radio programs in their local languages to learn more about agricultural practices and to obtain important market information.

The objective of this competition is to build a machine learning model to identify the agricultural keyword (which may be in English or Luganda) spoken in an audio clip. 

The keywords relate to crops, diseases, fertilizers, herbicides or other general agricultural topics.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

This dataset consists of 193 agricultural keywords in English and Lugandan compiled from agricultural talk shows taken from radio recordings in Uganda. 

These were complemented with data scraped from Bukedde which is an online Luganda newspaper in Uganda.
 
There are 1109 utterances in the train set and 1017 utterances in the test set.

We are grateful to the researchers and winners of the GIZ AI4D Africa Language Challenge who shared the recordings which made this competition possible.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge was Log Loss.


## Prizes

1st Place: $5 000 USD

2nd Place: $1 500 USD

3rd Place: $500 USD


## Benefits

These solutions will help researchers from Makerere University who are developing a speech recognition model to automate the process of monitoring Luganda radio programs for agriculture-related information.

These solutions will enable more efficient monitoring and analysis of local language radio programs, and your work can possibly open doors for this type of natural language processing tasks in other local languages across Africa and across other sectors that use radio as a means of communication.
