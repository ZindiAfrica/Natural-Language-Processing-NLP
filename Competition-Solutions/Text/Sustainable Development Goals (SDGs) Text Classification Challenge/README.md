# Competition Summary

## Description

SDG 3 has 14 targets and 27 indicators.

Each SDG has several “targets”, or social outcomes that the UN hopes to achieve by 2030. Each of these targets is measured using a set of indicators. 

These indicators represent the quantitative measurements that will be used to judge whether each SDG target has been achieved or not by 2030.

The aim of this competition is to classify text content by its relevance to the measurable indicators of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal #3 – Health and Well-Being (SDG 3).


## Competition Rule

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

The training data for this challenge includes approximately 3,000 web-scraped text from tenders, programs, and documents, as well as news articles about international development and humanitarian aid, and finally text descriptions of organizations involved in those sectors.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Hamming Loss metric be used to evaluate the accuracy of the submitted solutions


## Prizes

1st Place: $500 USD

2nd Place: $300 USD

3rd Place: $200 USD


## Benefits

Models like this one that classifies text content by relevant SDG indicators would be used to help algorithmically identify development projects, organizations, and documents that relate to the same SDG targets and indicators.

Such a tool would be useful for governments, development donors, and development implementers seeking to align resources, find partners, or perform outcomes-focused research.
