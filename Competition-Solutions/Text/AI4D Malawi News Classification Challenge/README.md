# Competition Summary

## Description

Algorithms for text classification still contain some open problems for example dealing with long pieces of texts and with texts in under-resourced languages.

Chichewa is a Bantu language spoken in much of Southern, Southeast and East Africa, namely the countries of Malawi and Zambia, where it is an official language, and Mozambique and Zimbabwe where it is a recognised minority language.

This challenge gives participants the opportunity to improve on text classification techniques and algorithms for text in Chichewa.

The task is to classify the news articles into one of 19 classes. The classes are mutually exclusive.

The objective of this challenge is to classify news articles.



## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).



## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

The data was collected from news publications in Malawi. tNyasa Ltd Data Science Lab have used three main broadcasters: the Nation Online newspaper, Radio Maria and the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation

The articles presented in the dataset are full articles and span many different genres: from social issues, family and relationships to political or economic issues.

The articles were cleaned by removing special characters and html tags.



## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.



## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)



## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.



## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge is Accuracy.


## Prizes

1st Place: $1 000 USD

2nd Place: $600 USD

3rd Place: $400 USD



## Benefits

This challenge gives participants the opportunity to improve on text classification techniques and algorithms for text in Chichewa.
