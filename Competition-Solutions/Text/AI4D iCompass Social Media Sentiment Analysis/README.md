# Competition Summary

## Description

On social media, Arabic speakers tend to express themselves in their own local dialect.

To do so, Tunisians use ‘Tunisian Arabizi’, where the Latin alphabet is supplemented with numbers. 

TUNIZI is the first 100% Tunisian Arabizi sentiment analysis dataset, developed as part of AI4D’s ongoing NLP project for African languages.

Sentiment analysis relies on multiple word senses and cultural knowledge, and can be influenced by age, gender and socio-economic status.

The objective of this challenge is to, given a sentence, classify whether the sentence is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 



## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

iCompass gathered comments from social media platforms that express sentiment about popular topics. For this purpose, we extracted 100k comments using public streaming APIs.

Tunizi was preprocessed by removing links, emoji symbols, and punctuations.

The collected comments were manually annotated using an overall polarity: positive (1), negative (-1) and neutral (0). The annotators were diverse in gender, age and social background.
